TODO (eventually):
- Hook up AI::onDamage and AI::onAIKilled from the Player::on* functions

TODO:
- Build integrated editor GUI (including createObject.gui and inspectObject.gui) so that the various panels can be positioned

General:
- If the game window won't come up at start, there's probably a syntax error in console.cs. Get the working console.cs and execute broken console.cs from it, to find the error line number.
- For any tag IDXXX = Y, Z
    - IDXXX == Y
    - *IDXXX == Z
- "$+" is the same operator as "@"

Client:
- Client requires IRCClient to be created, or will crash after connection, immediately after ghosting finishes.

Server:
- Volume file containing the palette cannot be created with a newObject call for some reason; an instant block is necessary. The palette may be constructed with a newObject call, however.

Focus problems:
- If focusServer()/focusClient() is called in a remote function when the client is connected to the server via loopback, the focus is not restored when the remote function returns,
  causing problems when a client is busy connecting (because if the connection finishes when server is focused, the client crashes on spawn), for instance. For this reason, at least
  in remote functions that could be called while the client is connecting, do not make focus calls (including push*Focus calls)
