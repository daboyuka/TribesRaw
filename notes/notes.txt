General:
- For any tag IDXXX = Y, Z
    - IDXXX == Y
    - *IDXXX == Z
- "$+" is the same operator as "@"

Gui:
- IDACTION_MENU_PAGE -> DarkStar calls remoteEval(2048, scoresOn / scoresOff) depending on if scores window is displayed
- play.gui load -> setCMMode(PlayChatMenu, 0); setCMMode(CommandChatMenu, 0);

Network:
- LOOPBACK does not work when serverDelegate is created before clientDelegate (clientDelegate overwrites the serverDelegate as receiving endpoint in that case)

Client:
- Loading play.gui crashes if unless IRCClient exists

Server:
- Volume file containing the palette cannot be created with a newObject call for some reason; an instant block is necessary. The palette may be constructed with a newObject call, however.

- Client::setGuiMode(%c, 1) -> loadPlayGui(); on client

Focus problems:
- focusClient/focusServer within a remote call during the process of connecting seems to cause a crash later, even if focus is restored before returning from the remote call
